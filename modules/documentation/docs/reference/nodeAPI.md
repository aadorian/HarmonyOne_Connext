# Node API Reference

There is one consolidated API across both the `server-node` and `browser-node`. Server nodes expose that interface via HTTP and gRPC (coming soon), and we additionally have [an example TS "client"](./modules/utils/src/serverNode.ts) which wraps the HTTP methods. The browser node exposes a TS interface only.

## Core Methods

### createNode

!!! Warning
    `createNode` is a `server-node` **only** method. It is not relevant to the `browser-node`. See the [indexed engines](../node/basics.md#indexed-engines) documentation for details.

Creates a new node engine (i.e. a new `signer` + `publicIdentifier`) at the given index.

!!! example
    === "TS" 

        ``` typescript
        const result = await node.createNode({
            index: 0
        });
        ```

    === "HTTP"

        ``` http
        ##############
        ### CREATE NODE
        POST {{nodeUrl}}/node
        Content-Type: application/json

        {
            "index": 0
        }
        ```

#### Params

`ServerNodeParams.CreateNode` object. Contains:

- `index`: `number` - used as part of the path along which a new key will be derived. This key is then used to create a new signer/public identifier/node engine. 

#### Returns

EITHER `ServerNodeResponses.CreateNode` object. Contains:

- `publicIdentifier`: Unique Connext-specific identifier for the node.
- `signerAddress`: Address of the key that is used to to sign messages in the channel. This is linked 1:1 with the `publicIdentifier`.
- `index`: Derivation index, same as what was passed in as a param.

        }
        ```

#### Params

`ServerNodeParams.ConditionalTransfer` object. Contains:

- `channelAddress`: `string` - Unique onchain address of the channel in which the transfer will be executed.
- `amount`: `string` - Amount to be transferred represented in decimal-free units. For instance, with $ETH we should use [wei units](https://eth-converter.com).
- `assetId`: `string` - Address of the asset on whatever chain your channel is on. For instance, the ERC20 contract address for a token on Ethereum. We use `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` to represent the base asset of the chain, e.g. $ETH on `chainId == 1`
- `recipient`: `string` - Identifier of the peer that you want to transfer to.
// TODO where do we have a list of transfernames?
- `type`: `string` - Either of a hardcoded `TransferName` if the transfer type is officially supported by Connext, OR a `transferDefinition`, which is the onchain address of the logic which will be used to govern the transfer.
- `details`: `object` - initial state of the transfer, used to set up the conditions which are used to unlock the transfer. This should be exactly the same as the `TransferState` defined in your `transferDefinition` contract.
- `recipientChainId`: `number` - (Optional) [chainId](https://chainid.network) of chain on which the recipient is located. The recipient's channel does not need to be on the same chain as the sender's channel - for example, you could send a transfer from Alice on Ethereum to Bob on Matic. If `recipientChainId` is not provided, it will default to the `chainId` of the sender's channel.
- `recipientAssetId`: `string` - (Optional) Similar to `recipientChainId`, the `assetId` that the recipient receives a transfer in does not need to be the same as the asset that the transfer is sent in. If intermediary routers are willing to provide liquidity, Alice can send a transfer in $ETH which can be receives by Bob in $DAI. If `recipientAssetId` is not provided, it will default to the `assetId` above.
- `meta`: `object` - (Optional) User-defined object for any additional metadata to be sent with the transfer creation e.g. Invoice numbers, messages, etc.

#### Returns

EITHER `ServerNodeResponses.ConditionalTransfer` object. Contains:

- `channelAddress`: `string` - Unique onchain address of your channel.
- `transferId`: `string` - Unique identifier for a given transfer.

OR [NodeError](https://github.com/connext/vector/blob/master/modules/types/src/error.ts#L177)

### resolveTransfer

### withdraw

A special kind of conditional transfer that sends assets in your channel to a specified onchain address. Can optionally include a fee as part of the withdraw which is charged by the counterparty if they submit the transaction on behalf of the withdrawer (i.e. if the counterparty is performing a [metatransaction](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/ethereum-meta-transactions-90ccf0859e84) to remove the withdrawer's need to pay gas)

            channelAddress: "0xABC123...",

- `channelAddress`: `string` - Unique onchain address of your channel.
